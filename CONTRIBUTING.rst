Please note the following guidelines for contributing:

* If you're fairly confident you've identified a bug or have already written a
  patch, feel free to open an issue or pull request. Otherwise, please discuss
  on the `mezzanine-users`_ mailing list first.
* Contributed code must be written in the existing style. For Python
  (and to a decent extent, JavaScript as well), this is as simple as
  following the `Django coding style`_ and (most importantly)
  `PEP 8`_. Front-end CSS should adhere to the
  `Bootstrap CSS guidelines`_.
* Contributions must be available on a separately named branch
  based on the latest version of the main branch.
* Run the tests before committing your changes. If your changes
  cause the tests to break, they won't be accepted.
* If you are adding new functionality, you must include basic tests
  and documentation.
